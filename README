This plugin provides a 'bzr rebase' command, in the same fashion of the 
famous git-rebase.

==========
How to use
==========

Simply run ``bzr rebase``, optionally specifying an upstream branch. If no branch is specified, 
it will use the current parent branch (which is usually what you want).

In the future, I hope it can also support rebasing on top of an unrelated branch.

============
How it works
============
The plugin will start off by writing a plan for the rebase, which it 
will write to .bzr/checkout/rebase-state. If the rebase is interrupted 
(conflicts that have to be resolved by the user) and 
needs to be continued or aborted, it will read this file to see what needs 
(still) needs to be done.

The rebase-state file contains the following information:
 * last-revision-info when the rebase was started
 * map of revisions that need to be replaced. In simple situations, 
   this would contain the revision on top of which the rebase is taking 
   place and the revisions that are only on the branch that is being 
   rebased.

   The map is from old revid to a tupole with new revid and new parents.

   For example, in the following scenario:

   A -> B -> C -> D main
        \ -> E -> F next

   Where next would be rebased on top of main, the replace map would look 
   something like this:

	E -> (E', [D])
	F -> (F', [E'])

   Corner cases would be situations like this:

    A -> B -> C -> D main
	     |\-> G -\
         \ -> E ---> F next

    Would G get rebased on top of D rather than B?
