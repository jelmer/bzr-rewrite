This plugin provides a 'bzr rebase' command, in the same fashion of the 
famous git-rebase.


How it works
============
The plugin will start off by writing a plan for the rebase, which it 
will write to .bzr/checkout/rebase-state. If the rebase is interrupted and 
needs to be continued or aborted, it will read this file to see what needs 
(still) needs to be done.

The rebase-state file contains the following information:
 * last-revision-info when the rebase was started
 * map of revisions that need to be replaced. In simple situations, 
   this would just be one revision. In more complex situations 
   (upgrading from one bzr-svn mapping version to another), it 
   could be a longer list.

   The map is from old to new revids.
 * map of revisions that need to be rewritten. In simple situations, 
   this would be the set of revisions between the upstream head and the 
   local working tree head.

   The map is from old to (planned) new revids.
